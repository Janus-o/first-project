    <p><big>A **visitor counter** machine built with an Arduino Nano and sensors (such as an ultrasonic or infrared sensor) detects people entering or leaving a room. The sensor captures the motion, and the Arduino processes the data to count each entry. This information is then displayed, often on an LCD screen or sent to a connected device. The setup is useful for tracking visitor numbers in real-time and is a common project for learning about sensors, microcontrollers, and basic electronics.</big></p>
